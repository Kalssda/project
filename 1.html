  <p style="margin-top:40px;">The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together providers of Machine Learning tools and frameworks with Web platform practitioners to enrich the Open Web Platform with better foundations for machine learning.</p>

<p>The secondary goals of the workshop are as follows:
Understand how machine learning fits into the Web <strong>technology</strong> stack,
Understand how browser-based machine learning fits into the machine learning <a href="https://en.dict.naver.com/#/entry/enko/36d5fac377fe4b29984c0dd39a0c726becosystem"

<br>Explore the impact of machine learning technologies on Web browsers and Web applications,
Evaluate the <u>opportunities</u> for standardization around machine learning APIs and formats.

<p>Expected topics of discussion include:
Dedicated machine learning APIs for browsers as explored by the Machine Learning for the Web Community Group</p>

<br>Integration of browser-provided data sources in machine learning workflows
Layering and interoperability of machine learning APIs with other computing APIs (e.g. WebGPU, WebAssembly)
Domain-specific machine learning APIs
Interchange format for machine learning models on the Web
<strong>Client- and cloud-based machine learning interactions
